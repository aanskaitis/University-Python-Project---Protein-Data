CSC1034: Practical 2
====================

The project's aim was to build a program, which analysis data of proteins.
I used data from: http://www.uniprot.org database.
The program is able to sort different kinds of protein into a taxonomy and show the average length of one protein sequence.

You can use these codes in the terminal:
=
**pipenv run python uniplot.py dump**

**pipenv run python uniplot.py list**

**pipenv run python uniplot.py average**

You can also use:
=
**pipenv run python uniplot.py plot-average-by-taxa**

to see a bar chart of taxonomy of protein.
